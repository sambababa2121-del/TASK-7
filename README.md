Open your browser’s extension/add-ons manager

Depending on the browser, this can be accessed through settings:

Chrome/Edge: Menu → More Tools → Extensions

Firefox: Menu → Add-ons and Themes

Safari: Preferences → Extensions

2. Review all installed extensions carefully

Make a list of all extensions currently installed.

Note the purpose of each one (e.g., ad-blocker, password manager, productivity tool).

Check if you actually use it or if it was installed automatically during software installation.

3. Check permissions and reviews for each extension

See what permissions are requested (e.g., “Access to all websites” or “Read browsing history”).

Compare the requested permissions with the extension’s purpose.

Look at user ratings and reviews on the official extension store to spot red flags.

4. Identify any unused or suspicious extensions

Mark extensions you haven’t used in a long time.

Look for unknown publishers, misspelled names, or extensions that don’t seem necessary.

Suspicious signs include:

High permissions without clear reason

Low ratings or many complaints in reviews

Recently installed without your knowledge

5. Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions

Use the Remove/Delete/Uninstall option in the extension manager.

Disable (instead of deleting) if you’re unsure, then test your browser.

Keep only trusted and useful extensions from official sources.

6. Restart browser and check for performance improvements

Close and reopen your browser.

Notice if browsing speed, memory usage, or startup time improves.

Some malicious or poorly designed extensions slow down performance significantly.

7. Research how malicious extensions can harm users

Malicious extensions can:

Steal browsing history, passwords, or credit card details

Insert ads, pop-ups, or redirect you to fake websites

Track your online activity and sell data

Use your computer resources for hidden tasks (like crypto-mining)

8. Document steps taken and extensions removed

Example documentation:

Browser used: Google Chrome

Extensions before review: AdBlock, Grammarly, PDF Viewer, Unknown “Shopping Helper”

Suspicious extension found: “Shopping Helper” (unknown publisher, asked for all-site access, poor reviews)

Action taken: Removed “Shopping Helper”

Result: Browser runs faster, fewer pop-ups observed

Learning: Malicious extensions can steal data or slow performance; only keep trusted ones.
